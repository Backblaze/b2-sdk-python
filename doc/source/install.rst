Installing as a dependency
==========================

**b2sdk** can simply be added to ``requirements.txt`` (or equivalent such as ``setup.py``, ``.pipfile`` etc).
In order to properly set a dependency, see :ref:`versioning chapter <semantic_versioning>` for details.

.. note::
  The stability of your application depends on correct :ref:`pinning of versions <semantic_versioning>`.


Installing a development version
================================

To install **b2sdk**, checkout the repository and run::

 pip install b2sdk

in your python environment.

Installing B2 SDK
=================

Safety first
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. caution:: Correct version pinning is necessary to make sure your code remains compatible with upcoming b2sdk releases.

  See :ref:`this <semver>` chapter for details.

Installing for development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

B2 SDK runs on Python 2.7+ under CPython and PyPy.

To install B2 SDK, simply run::

 pip install b2sdk

In your python environment.

.. note:: If you see a message saying that the ``six`` library cannot be installed, which
  happens if you're installing with the system python on OS X El Capitan, try this::

    pip install --ignore-installed b2sdk


Developer Info
==============

We encourage outside contributors to perform changes on our codebase. Many such changes have been merged already. In order to make it easier to contribute, core developers of this project:

* provide guidance (through the issue reporting system)
* provide tool assisted code review (through the Pull Request system)
* maintain a set of integration tests (run with a production cloud)
* maintain a set of (well over a hundred) unit tests
* automatically run unit tests on 14 versions of python (including osx, Jython and pypy)
* format the code automatically using `yapf <https://github.com/google/yapf>`_
* use static code analysis to find subtle/potential issues with maintainability
* maintain other Continous Integration tools (coverage tracker)

You'll need to some Python packages installed.  To get all the latest things::

 pip install --upgrade --upgrade-strategy eager -r requirements.txt -r requirements-test.txt -r requirements-setup.txt

There is a `Makefile` with a rule to run the unit tests using the currently active Python::

 make setup
 make test

will install the required packages, then run the unit tests.

To test in multiple python virtual environments, set the enviroment variable ``PYTHON_VIRTUAL_ENVS``
to be a space-separated list of their root directories.  When set, the makefile will run the
unit tests in each of the environments.

Before checking in, use the ``pre-commit.sh`` script to check code formatting, run
unit tests, run integration tests etc.

The integration tests need a file in your home directory called ``.b2_auth``
that contains two lines with nothing on them but your account ID and application key::

 accountId
 applicationKey

We marked the places in the code which are significantly less intuitive than others in a special way. To find them occurrences, use ``git grep '*magic*'``.

## [1.16.0] - 2022-04-27

This release contains a preview of replication support. It allows for basic
usage of B2 replication feature (currently in closed beta).

As the interface of the sdk (and the server api) may change, the replication
support shall be considered PRIVATE interface and should be used with caution.
Please consult the documentation on how to safely use the private api interface.

In `b2sdk.v3` the `B2Api` will always create `cache` from `AccountInfo` object, unless `cache` is provided explicitly.
The current stable `b2sdk.v2` remains unchanged, i.e. `DummyCache` is created by default if `account_info` was provided, but not `cache`.
Documentation for `b2sdk.v2` was updated with the new recommended usage, e.g. `B2Api(info, cache=AuthInfoCache(info))`, to achieve the same behavior as `b2sdk.v3`.

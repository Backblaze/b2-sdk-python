Remove Python 3.7 support in new releases.
Under Python 3.7 `pip` will keep resolving the latest version of the package that supports active interpreter.
Python 3.8 is now the minimum supported version, [until it reaches EOL in October 2024](https://devguide.python.org/versions/).
We encourage use of latest stable Python release.

    The patterns used to match directory names (and file names) are allowed
    to match a prefix of the name.  This 'feature' was unintentional, but is
    being retained for compatibility.

    This means that a regex that matches a directory name can't be used directly
    to match against a file name and test whether the file should be excluded
    because it matches the directory.

    The pattern 'photos' will match directory names 'photos' and 'photos2',
    and should exclude files 'photos/kitten.jpg', and 'photos2/puppy.jpg'.
    It should not exclude 'photos.txt', because there is no directory name
    that matches.

    On the other hand, the pattern 'photos$' should match 'photos/kitten.jpg',
    but not 'photos2/puppy.jpg', nor 'photos.txt'

    If the original regex is valid, there are only two cases to consider:
    either the regex ends in '$' or does not.
